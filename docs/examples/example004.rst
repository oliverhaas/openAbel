example004_fullComparison
=================

This example provides a rather extensive comparison of different **openAbel** methods. It shows how well the main methods perform in every regard, especially if the input data is sufficiently smooth. Most importantly one can see the fast convergence of the higher order methods in the bottom left plot, and the linear computational complexity of the main methods in the bottom middle and right plots.
