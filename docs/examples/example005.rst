example005_comparisonPyAbel
=================

This example provides a rather extensive comparison of different **openAbel** methods with
`PyAbel <https://www.github.com/PyAbel/PyAbel>`_ methods. It shows how well the main methods of **openAbel** perform in every regard, especially if the input data is sufficiently smooth. 

Since **PyAbel**'s focus is on the backward (or inverse) transform, this example does it as well.
